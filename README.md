# Example Node.js API using Express, TypeScript, Vue, and PostgreSQL

This example application shows how to create a Node.js Express web app using TypeScript. Please read [Use TypeScript to Build a Node API with Express](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript) to see how this app was created.

## Requirements

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 8+
* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or some other instance of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/))

## Development setup

* Clone or download this repository
* Install modules using `npm install`
* Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`
* Set up [PostgreSQL with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/samples/library/postgres/). With docker installed, use the following two commands to create an instance of PostgreSQL for the application. Feel free to change the name and password for the database.

```bash
docker pull postgres:latest
docker run -d --name guitar-db -p 5432:5432 -e 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd42' postgres
```

* Modify `.env` to match your PostgreSQL server connection and credentials
* Initialize the PostgreSQL database by running `npm run initdb`
* Create a free [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)
* Set up a new Okta application

    1. In the Applications section, click "Add Application"
    2. Select "Web" and click Next
    3. Name your application, and set the Login Redirect URIs to `http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback`. By default, the web application will run locally at http://localhost:8080. Click Save.

* On the Application screen under the General tab you will find a section for "Client Credentials." You will need to copy the values for "Client ID" and "Client secret" and paste them into the `.env` file for `OKTA_CLIENT_ID` and `OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET`, respectively.
* Copy the URL for your Okta developer account (e.g. `https://dev-123456-admin.oktapreview.com`) and paste it into the `.env` file as the value for `OKTA_ORG_URL`. Remove `-admin` from the URL. The setting should look similar to:

```
OKTA_ORG_URL=https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com
```

## Launching application

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the web application should now be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
